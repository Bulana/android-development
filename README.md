This app has two buttons and a text view.

Two buttons, one for incrementing and the second for decrementing the number in text view.

The main purpose of this app is to show understanding of how to use android layouts and widgets.

I ended up using listeners for handling click events, which makes more sense to me than using the xml onClick method.
