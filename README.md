This is where we create a simple user interface off of the android developer site.

What is the interface made of?

The interface is made of layouts and widgets hierarchy. Layouts are ViewGroup objects and widgets are Vew objects. 

Layouts are containers that control how their child views are positioned on the screen, ok. Widgets are UI componets such as buttons and text boxes.
