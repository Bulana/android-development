What is Android? 

My less informed non scientific response is that Android is not an OS nor a Frameword but rather a platform in which developers can use to interact with the hardware of the devices.
    
Correct Answer is...
    
    Is a Mobile Operating System based on Linux Kernel
    
Should we just igonre the big word facing us, or just skip it and hope it will not be used again?
No. Lets unpack Linux Kernel real quick.

A kernel is the lowest level of easy replaceable software that interfaces with the hardware in computers. Ok? Not ok, 
It is responsible for interfacing all of the applications that are running in user mode down to the physical hardware, and allowing processes, known as servers to get information from each other using the IPCinterprocess communication. Ok, makes little sense...ill create a branch fdedicated to kernals.

back to Android...
